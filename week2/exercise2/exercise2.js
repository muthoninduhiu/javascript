// Exercise 2.0
/*Let’s create a function to add two numbers together. They can be
any two numbers you can think of. To demonstrate this, we’ll start by writing a function
called addTwoNumbers.*/
/*Exercise 2.1
The function should have two parameters, num1 and num2. It should then return these two
numbers added together.*/
function addNumbers(a,b){
    return a + b
}
/*Exercise 2.2
Test this function with the following numbers:
- 2, 2
- 9, 3
- 2938, 2
The results should be 4, 12, and 2940.*/
console.log(addNumbers(2,2))
console.log(addNumbers(9,3))
console.log(addNumbers(2938,2))

4
 12
2940
